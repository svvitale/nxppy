The license granted in Section 2 does not include any license, right, power or authority to cause the Licensed Materials or Modifications, in whole or in part, to be subject to Open Source Licensing Terms.  Licensee shall not, and shall not permit any third party to (i) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any object code portions of the Licensed Materials, (ii) remove or alter any proprietary markings or notices from the Licensed Materials, or (iii) otherwise use any portion of the Licensed Materials or Modifications in any manner not expressly authorized in Section 2.

Licensee agrees to use at least the same physical and other security measures for the Licensed Materials as Licensee uses for its own highly confidential information and documentation, however, in no event less than a reasonable degree of care.  Licensee agrees that it shall be responsible for violations of this obligation by its employees, contractors and/or any third party receiving such Licensed Materials from Licensee.  Licensee agrees to notify NXP promptly in the event of circumstances in which it would appear that any portion of the Licensed Materials have been prejudiced or exposed to loss or disclosure, and Licensee shall, upon NXP’s request, take reasonable steps necessary to recover any such compromised Licensed Materials.  The cost of taking such reasonable steps shall be borne solely by Licensee.  Notwithstanding the above, this Section 4 does not apply to Redistributable Object Code.

5.	Ownership; Reservation of Rights.  This Agreement does not transfer any ownership interest in the Licensed Materials.  Except for those rights specifically granted in Section 2: (i) NXP, its Affiliates and their suppliers reserve all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Materials and Modifications, and (ii) no other express or implied license, right or interest in any patent, patent application, copyright, trade secret, trademark or any other intellectual property right are granted hereunder.

Licensee may terminate this Agreement, at any time for any or no reason.  This Agreement will automatically terminate if Licensee fails to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement.  Upon any termination of this Agreement: (i) all rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement shall immediately terminate; (ii) Licensee shall promptly return to NXP or, at NXP’s discretion, destroy all of the Licensed Materials, Modifications and all whole and partial copies thereof (including without limitation all Redistributable Object Code); (iii) within thirty (30) days after such termination, Licensee shall furnish to NXP a written certification that all of the Licensed Materials, Modifications and all whole and partial copies thereof, have been (a) destroyed or returned to NXP, and (b) erased from all of Licensee’s storage elements and devices; and (iv) Licensee shall not keep any archival copies of the Licensed Materials or Modifications except and only to the extent that applicable law notwithstanding this limitation expressly permits such.  All defined terms, Section 2.5 and Sections 3 through 12 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.  In addition, any termination of this Agreement shall not affect the rights of Licensee’s customers regarding Redistributable Object Code properly furnished to such customers before such termination.

7.	Remedies.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that, if NXP is required to bring an action to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, the damages may be irreparable and difficult to measure and NXP shall be entitled to seek equitable relief including a preliminary injunction in addition to any other relief available.  Licensee agrees that in the event that NXP seeks an injunction hereunder, Licensee hereby waives any requirement for the posting of a bond or any other security.
